develop the above design following the guidelines:
-the total goal of donation is $5,000
-donation cannot be less then $5
-upon receiving donation, total, progress bar, and number of donors should be updated

edge cases looked at: if donation is less than 5 a helpful message pops up. If donation is not a number a helpful message pops up.

Once the initial amount needed is reached ($5,000) a celebratory message pops up but donations are still received.
